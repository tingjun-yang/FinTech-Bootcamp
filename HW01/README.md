[Venmo](https://venmo.com/) is an American Peer to Peer mobile payment service founded in 2009. The name "Venmmo" came from the Latin word "vendere" which means "to sell" and "mo" meaning mobile. It was founded by Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail, who met as freshman roommates at the University of Pennsylvania. According to this [article](https://medium.com/@telgar/venmo-the-wallet-of-the-future-d45900b6811b), the idea came to them when Magdon-Ismail went to New York City to visit Kortina for the weekend and forgot his wallet. Kortina being the good friend that he is, covered Magdon-Ismail’s expenses for the weekend. When Magdon-Ismail was trying to pay back Kortina by mailing a check, they realized there must be a more streamline way to pay a friend.

This is where the idea for Venmo came to life. Venmo was first designed as a text message based Peer to Peer payment platform. Kortina and Magdon-Ismail sent each other the first text message payments. They needed to make Venmo into an app to harness it’s full potential. 

In May 2010, the company raised $1.2 million of seed money in a financing round led by [RRE Ventures](https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/16/venmo-1-2-million-iphone/).

In 2012, the company was acquired by [Braintree](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120817005685/en/Braintree-Acquires-Mobile-Payments-Platform-Venmo) for $26.2 million.

In December 2013, [PayPal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131219005777/en/eBay-Completes-Acquisition-Global-Payments-Innovator-Braintree) acquired Braintree for $800 million.

In April 2021, Venmo announced that it is beginning its roll out for the ability to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies using the platform ([Ref](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/)).

Digital payments have become increasingly widespread with the growth of e-commerce and mobile device infrastructure. As one of the largest online payment processors in the world, PayPal was established as Confinity in 1998 and was acquired by eBay in 2002. PayPal revolutionized the way people pay businesses online, but it did not develope a system for paying friends easily. 

Venmo was launched in 2009 to fill this void as a fee-free, digital way to ferry money between friends. It was aimed at friends and family who wish to split bills, e.g. for movies, dinner, rent, or event tickets etc. The app also pioneered the idea of social payments by publishing users’ transactions and memos in an emoji-filled conversational stream—catnip for millennials ([Ref](https://www.fastcompany.com/40400786/how-peer-to-peer-payment-pioneer-venmo-grew-up-and-got-serious)).

The first prototype worked over SMS and was incredibly simple. To send Iqram $20, all Andrew had to do was text “iqram 20” to the number they’d set up (which was a hacked Google Voice account) and Iqram would see “kortina paid you $20.”

They quickly decided they needed to include a note with each payment so they could keep track of what each one was for. So, the input looked like this: “iqram 20 for chinese food.” On Iqram’s end, he’d receive a message saying, “kortina paid you $20 for chinese food.”

The Venmo messages in people's SMS inbox started to look like a news feed of all the restaurants, bars, and shows we were going to. Andrew and Iqram decided that people should be able to share this stuff, so they added the #p option, which would make the payment show up in friends’ feeds on venmo.com ([Ref](https://thehustle.co/how-venmo-started/)). The social aspect of the digital payment is a unique feature of Venmo. 

Currently, both Venmo and its competitor Zelle use Clearing House’s real-time-payments network to facilitate money transfers. For decades, retailers have protested the fees Visa and Mastercard charge them to accept credit and debit cards. “Pay by bank” is the latest effort to circumvent those fees by letting people pay directly from their bank accounts. The pay-by-bank product uses the real-time-payments (RTP) network operated by The Clearing House, an organization owned by 23 of the largest banks including Citibank, Wells Fargo and HSBC, with lower fees than the card networks ([Ref](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2022/08/26/new-payment-service-using-same-tech-as-zelle-and-venmo-will-cut-out-visa-and-mastercard-fees/?sh=53ef73cd3343)).

## Landscape

Venmo is in the payments domain of the financial industry, in particular, the Peer to Peer (P2P) payment. 

According to this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/p2p-payment-market-size-share-demand-trends-analysis-forecast-ashley/?trk=pulse-article), P2P payment is the transfer of money from one person's bank account to another person's bank account. P2P transactions are initiated and completed by two individuals transferring money between banks over the Internet. Furthermore, a P2P payment solution allows individuals to request a specific payment amount from a specific person in their connection. Due to the increasing use of smartphones and the adoption of m-commerce, the majority of P2P end users are millennials. Consumer acceptance of mobile banking, internet banking, and e-commerce, as well as increasing smartphone penetration among the younger generation, is driving the expansion of the P2P payment business.

Although the Covid-19 outbreak has negatively affected many sectors, it has offered a growth accelerator for the P2P payments market. Moreover, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a higher population around the world started using cashless and contactless payment methods, which facilitated the expansion of the P2P payment market. In addition, the pandemic has significantly accelerated digital transactions. This trend of digital and contactless payments has increased. Consequently, the worldwide market for P2P payments market is expected to drive market growth during the forecast period.

Mobile commerce has been growing for years. Additionally, the increase in smartphone demand and convenience factors positively impact the growth of the P2P payment market. Furthermore, with most mobile commerce-enabled platforms, the device is usually connected to a wireless network that can be used for online shopping. Furthermore, when the device is paired with bank card data, the cell phone is used to make the payment.

In the US, popular mobile P2P platforms include Paypal's Venmo, Square's Cash App, and Zelle, with their relatively small gross payment volumes, P2P platforms are seeing rapid adoption. Cash App and Zelle, in particular, are relative latecomers, but they have surpassed earlier entrants Venmo in terms of app downloads and payment volume.

Venmo pioneered in the P2P payment. In 2022 the company handled $244 billion in transactions and generated $850 million in revenue ([Ref](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/venmo-statistics/)). However, it also faces challenges from the latecomers such as Cash App launched in 2013 and Zelle launched in 2016. The following figures show the annual revenue and annual payment volume for the three P2P platforms. The data are taken from [Ref1](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/venmo-statistics/), [Ref2](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/cash-app-statistics/), [Ref3](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/cash-app-statistics/) and [Ref4](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/chart/256010/us-peer-to-peer-p2p-mobile-payment-users-by-platform-2019-2026-millions). The figures were made using Jupyter [notebook](venmo_cash_zelle.ipynb).

It can be seen that even though Zelle still has the largest number of users, it has been surpassed in revenue and payment volume by the other two competitors.
